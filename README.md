⌨️ Code Typing Challenge Game (OOPs Project)

A Code Typing Challenge Game developed using Java (OOP concepts) with a HTML & CSS based interface.
The game helps users improve their coding typing speed by showing live WPM (Words Per Minute) and accuracy while typing code, and displays a final performance report after completion.
This project is created as an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) lab project under the supervision of Lab Assistant: Sir Sobaan Shakeel.

🎯 Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
Apply Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java
Improve programming typing skills
Calculate real-time WPM and accuracy
Build an interactive and educational typing game for students

🎮 Features

Code-based typing challenges
Live WPM calculation
Live typing accuracy (%)
Timer-based typing system
Final result summary after completing the challenge
Clean and simple UI using HTML & CSS

🧠 OOP Concepts Used (Java)
Classes and Objects
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Inheritance
Polymorphism

🕹️ How the Game Works
A code snippet is displayed on the screen
The user starts typing the code
The system:
Tracks time
Calculates WPM live
Calculates accuracy in real time
When typing is completed:
Final WPM is shown
Final accuracy is shown
Performance summary is displayed

📥 Input
User keystrokes (typed code)

📤 Output
Live WPM
Live Accuracy
Final Typing Speed
Final Accuracy Report

🛠 Technologies Used
