<h1 align="center">⌨️ Code Typing Challenge (OOP Project)</h1>

<p align="center">
  <b>🚀 Master your coding speed with real-time WPM and Accuracy metrics.</b>
</p>

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
A **Java-based typing game** built to bridge the gap between backend logic and interactive UI. This project helps developers master their typing speed for code rather than just plain text, providing real-time metrics for Words Per Minute (WPM) and accuracy.

> **University Project:** 2nd Semester OOP Lab Project  
> **Supervisor:** Sir Sobaan Shakeel  
> **Course:** Object-Oriented Programming (UBIT)

## 🧠 OOP Architecture
This project serves as a practical implementation of **Object-Oriented Programming** principles. The backend logic is structured using:

* **Classes & Objects:** Modular design for game states and user metrics.
* **Encapsulation:** Secure handling of user data and performance calculations.
* **Abstraction:** Hiding complex timing logic behind simple interfaces.
* **Inheritance & Polymorphism:** Scalable code structure for different challenge types.

## 🎮 Key Features
- **Code-Specific Challenges:** Real programming snippets instead of generic text.
- **Real-Time Analytics:** Live tracking of **WPM** and **Accuracy (%)**.
- **Interactive UI:** A clean interface built with **HTML & CSS** for a modern feel.
- **Performance Report:** Detailed summary displayed instantly upon completion.

## 🕹️ How the Game Works
1.  **Selection:** The system loads a specific code snippet.
2.  **Tracking:** As soon as you start typing, the timer initiates.
3.  **Live Feedback:** The system monitors every keystroke to calculate accuracy and speed.
4.  **Final Result:** Once finished, you receive a full breakdown of your performance.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- [ ] **Multi-Language Support:** Challenges for Python, C++, and JavaScript.
- [ ] **Difficulty Tiers:** Levels ranging from "Beginner" to "Senior Dev."
- [ ] **Global Leaderboard:** Saving high scores using local storage or a backend.
